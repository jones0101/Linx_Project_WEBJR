#  LINX DIGITAL CHALLENGE - WEB DESIGNER JR - JONES GUIMARÃES


### About the challenge:
Hi! First of all I want to thank you guys for the opportunity! 🙏🏻

🚀  The Challenge was very exciting to do, I learned a lot from the beginning of the project and regardless of the result, makes me realize I can do so much more that I thought I could.

🧠 The biggest thing I’ve learn with this challenge was to try your best e just go for it. Sometimes you need to push a little harder.

🧩 The most difficult part of the project was Sass - The thing I wasn’t able to do it , yet. I’m not really used to work with preprocessing, but what I was able to do was working with .scss. It's a start. :)


## Status:
 🚧  Developing 

## Issues

- Overlapping content when '.article:hover' is active. The height expands overlapping the classes ‘.deadline’ and ‘.late’ from article.
